# Daily Notes - Popup Windows in Web Development

Popup windows, a historical method for displaying additional content to users, have been a longstanding feature in web development. The fundamental concept involves opening a new window with a designated URL using the `window.open` method. However, in contemporary web browsers, this often translates to opening new tabs instead of distinct windows. While popups have a rich history, they are no longer the primary choice for presenting supplementary content. Modern web development embraces alternative techniques such as dynamically loading content with fetch and displaying it within dynamically generated HTML elements like `<div>`. This shift in approach is partly driven by the challenges posed by popups on mobile devices, which generally do not support the simultaneous display of multiple windows. Despite this, popups still serve valuable purposes in specific scenarios, notably in OAuth authorization processes, where their separate window with an independent JavaScript environment ensures security, ease of implementation, and the ability to navigate and communicate with the parent window.

## Daily Notes

### Popups and Window Methods
Popup windows represent a historical method for displaying additional web content, and while they have evolved over time, they are no longer the primary means of achieving this goal. Alternative methods have emerged to address modern web development needs, although popups retain their relevance in specific contexts like OAuth authorization due to their safety and ease of implementation.

### Activity 1 - Popup Blocking
In the past, some malicious websites used pop-up windows excessively to display ads, causing a nuisance for users. To counter this, most modern web browsers have implemented pop-up blocking mechanisms for user protection. Browsers generally allow pop-ups only when they are triggered by user-initiated actions, such as clicking on a button. For instance, if a pop-up window is opened using JavaScript's `window.open` method outside of a user-triggered event handler, like `onclick`, it will likely be blocked by the browser. However, there's an interesting nuance with timing. For example, if a pop-up is scheduled using `setTimeout`, Firefox is more permissive and allows pop-ups if the delay is 2000ms or less, considering it part of the user's action. But if the delay exceeds 2000ms, Firefox assumes it's no longer associated with the user's interaction and may block the pop-up. This behavior ensures a balance between blocking intrusive pop-ups and preserving user functionality.

### window.open
To open a popup window in JavaScript, you use the syntax `window.open(url, name, params)`. The `url` parameter specifies the web address to load in the new window. The `name` parameter lets you specify a name for the new window; if a window with that name already exists, the URL will load in it; otherwise, a new window is created. The `params` parameter is a configuration string for the new window, containing settings separated by commas. These settings include positioning (left/top coordinates), dimensions (width/height), and window features like showing or hiding the browser menu, navigation toolbar, URL field, status bar, resizable option, and scrollbars. It's important to note that some of these features may not be fully supported in all browsers, and it's generally not recommended to disable resizing or scrollbars for a good user experience. Additionally, there are some less commonly used browser-specific features available.

### Accessing Popup from Window
The content illustrates how to use the `window.open` method to create and manipulate popup windows in JavaScript. In the first example, a new window with specified dimensions is generated, and its content is customized using `newWin.document.write`. The second example demonstrates the importance of waiting for the `onload` event before modifying a newly opened window, as the window isn't fully loaded immediately after creation. This ensures that the content is ready for manipulation. Additionally, the content emphasizes the "Same Origin Policy," which restricts windows from freely accessing each other's content unless they originate from the same origin, defined by having the same protocol, domain, and port. This policy helps enhance security in web applications.

### Accessing Window from Popup
A popup window can access the "opener" window using the `window.opener` reference. However, this reference is null for all windows except for popups. The example code given demonstrates that by creating a new popup window with specified dimensions and then replacing the content of the opener (current) window with the text "Test" using a script executed within the popup. This bidirectional connection allows both the main window and the popup to have a reference to each other, enabling them to interact and exchange information.

### Closing a Popup
In this explanation, it's outlined how to manipulate and check the status of windows in JavaScript. To close a window, the `win.close()` method is used, but it's important to note that `window.close()` is typically only effective for windows created with `window.open()`. This means it will work as expected for popups. To check if a window is closed, you can use the `win.closed` property, which is set to true if the window is closed. This property is useful for verifying whether a popup or the main window is still open, as users can close it at any time. The provided code example opens a new window, waits for it to load, then closes it and checks if it's closed, resulting in an alert displaying "true" once the window is closed.

### Scrolling and Resizing
This explains several methods for moving and resizing windows in JavaScript. For window movement, `win.moveBy(x, y)` is used to shift the window relative to its current position, allowing both positive (right and down) and negative (left and up) values. `win.moveTo(x, y)` relocates the window to specific coordinates on the screen. For resizing, `win.resizeBy(width, height)` adjusts the window's dimensions relative to its current size, accepting negative values, while `win.resizeTo(width, height)` sets the window to an exact size. These methods are generally blocked by browsers to prevent misuse and typically work reliably only on popups that were directly opened by the script and don't have additional tabs. It's worth noting that JavaScript cannot minimize or maximize windows, as these functions are controlled at the operating system level and not accessible to frontend developers. Additionally, the move and resize methods don't function on maximized or minimized windows.

### Scrolling a Window
This delves into techniques for scrolling a window in JavaScript. The `win.scrollBy(x, y)` method shifts the window's view by a specified number of pixels to the right (x) and down (y) relative to the current scroll position. Negative values are accepted for both x and y, allowing scrolling in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, `win.scrollTo(x, y)` directly moves the window's scroll position to the specified coordinates (x, y). For scrolling to a specific element in the document, the `elem.scrollIntoView(top = true)` function can be used. By default, it scrolls the window to make the element appear at the top, but you can set `top` to `false` to make it appear at the bottom. Additionally, the `window.onscroll` event allows you to listen for scroll events on the window, enabling you to trigger actions or respond to user scrolling.

### Focus/Blur on a Window
Here we explore the concepts of focusing and blurring windows in JavaScript, as well as the associated events. In the past, certain malicious pages used tactics to lock users within a window by continuously refocusing it when an attempt was made to switch out. However, there are limitations in place to prevent such behavior, which vary depending on the browser. For instance, mobile browsers often ignore these calls, and focusing doesn't work when a popup opens in a separate tab rather than a new window. Despite these restrictions, there are still practical uses for focusing and blurring windows. For example, when opening a popup, running `newWindow.focus()` can be a good practice to ensure that the user interacts with the new window. Additionally, tracking `window.onfocus` and `window.onblur` events can help monitor when a visitor actively uses a web application, enabling adjustments to in-page activities and animations. It's important to note that the blur event signifies that the user has switched out of the window, but the window may still be visible in the background.

### Activity 3 - Coding Popups
Creating popups on your website involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First, you design the popup's structure in HTML, including a container and its content. CSS can be used to style the popup for a visually appealing look. JavaScript is then employed to control the popup's behavior: opening and closing it. You typically use event listeners to trigger the popup's display, such as clicking a button or a link. Customizing the content within the popup and adding any desired functionality, like form submission or animations, can further enhance the user experience. Popups provide a way to display additional information or interactions without navigating to a new page, improving the overall usability of your website.

### My Views on the Day
Creating popups in web development involves using the `window.open` method to open new browser windows or tabs. This method allows developers to display additional content, but it's important to note that modern browsers often block popups by default to protect users from intrusive or malicious behavior. When creating popups, it's crucial to trigger them through user-initiated events like `onclick` to ensure they are not blocked by the browser.

### Day 1 Reflections
The syntax for `window.open` includes specifying the URL, window name, and configuration settings for the new window. These settings control various aspects like window dimensions, location visibility, and more. The content also discusses browser-specific behaviors, such as Firefox's handling of popups based on timing. Overall, creating popups offers a valuable tool for presenting information or interactions without navigating to a new page, enhancing the usability of your website while considering user experience and security concerns.
